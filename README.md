The challenge here is to implement a Reverse Polish Notation calculator. [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Explanation), a.k.a. postfix notation, is a mathematical notation that removes the needs for parentheses.

Please clone the repo, `cd` to this directory, run `npm install`, and then make the tests pass without using `eval`. Do not worry about edge cases not covered by the tests.

Run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```
or run the tests with a debugger attached
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

If a debugger catches, do `c` to continue, or `.exit` to exit. Once you're at a spot you want to debug, type `repl`.
